# JS-Practice
Short collaboration of tiny JS Projects. Like seriously, none of these are that impressive. Most are from when I first started learning JavaScript. Alot of them require the console to see anything. All of the JS names correspond to the HTML, but the HTML pages have nothing or next to nothing on them. These were humble beginnings, but we have to start somewhere right?
